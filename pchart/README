This is the lib directory from a checkout of the PHP5 port of the pChart
1.x library. We can't use the pChart 2.x library because of unclear license
conditions.

For the same reasons we do not include the orginal fonts, but use the DroidSans
font which is licensed under the Apache License.

We're currently at this commit (master branch):
https://github.com/sebix/pChart/commit/52ad6a2612d1a9a9e6999c1a6b6aaeec94d5ab70

This seems to be the most up-to-date version of the library today (2012-02-07).
When updating later, make sure to have a look at the current state of forks.

This is how it looks like currently
